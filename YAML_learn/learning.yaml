# YAML is a data serialization language which is used to convert (objects + code) as well as documents into a human readable file which
#  can be used to transmit them to downstream programs.

#  YAML is a collection of one or more documents or data bolcks separated by <---> and the end is signified by <...> 

#  Indentation is important and is taken care of with spaces not tabs. It is also case sensitive.

# .yml or .yaml extension is valid, .yaml is widely used and preferred.


# Example of key-value pairs:
"apple" : "I am a red fruit"
